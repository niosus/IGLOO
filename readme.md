# IGLOO: Intuitive openGL Object Oriented library #

This is a library that wraps OpenGL library into objects. It aims to be close to zero-overhead in terms of runtime while offering intuitive and safe interfaces to underlying OpenGL library. The core idea is to make it hard to make a mistake that is hard to debug while not incurring too high cost for such guarantees. The library tries to use static memory allocation where possible, using traits to make sure the sizes of types are guessed correctly and are translated into OpenGL types properly.

#### ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§ ####
I am by far not an expert in OpenGL and constructive feedback and/or corrections are welsome. This library is also not complete and will be so for the observable future. Things may change, APIs broken and all the hell can break loose. That being said, I would love to see other people using this and hopefully someday it will reach a stable state. 

## How to build ##

Building the library and running the tests should be as simple as:
```bash
bazel build //...  # build
bazel test --test_output=errors --test_env=DISPLAY=:0 //...  # test
```

### Prerequisites ###
The build is not fully hermetic and relies on some libraries present on your system. On Ubuntu 20.04 you would need to install some libraries. You can find the list in the [build job script](.github/workflows/main.yml).

### Warning ###
For now, because of this [issue](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11554) you will need to create a symlink for python on Ubuntu 20.04:
```cmd
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python 
```

## Examples ##
I try to follow the tutorials from this awesome tutorial: https://learnopengl.com/ 

You can find the implementations for some of these using IGLOO in the folder [examples/opengl_tutorials/](examples/opengl_tutorials/)

## Credits ##
The underlying library is inspired by other efforts to achieve OOP approach to
OpenGL. Most notably a library of my ex-colleague [Dr. Jens Behley](https://github.com/jbehley):
